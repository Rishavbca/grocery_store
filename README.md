# grocery_store
This is a full-stack Grocery Store web application built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. It provides a dynamic and responsive user interface for browsing and purchasing groceries online. The front-end is crafted using HTML5 and CSS3 for layout and styling, with JavaScript enhancing interactivity (e.g., cart updates, product filtering). The back-end is developed in PHP, handling user authentication, order processing, and server-side logic. MySQL is used for managing product listings, user data, and order histories. Admin features include product management, order tracking, and customer management via a secure dashboard. The project demonstrates CRUD operations, session management, and secure database interaction. Ideal for learning or adapting into a small e-commerce platform, this project is a solid example of integrating front-end and back-end technologies in a practical, real-world scenario.
